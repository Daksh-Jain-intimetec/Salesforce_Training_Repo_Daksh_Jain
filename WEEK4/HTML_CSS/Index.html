            HTML is the standard markup language for creating Web pages <br>
            HTML describes the structure of a Web page <br>
            HTML consists of a series of elements <br>
            HTML elements tell the browser how to display the content <br>
            HTML elements label pieces of content such as "this is a heading", "this is a paragraph", "this is a link", etc.</p>
